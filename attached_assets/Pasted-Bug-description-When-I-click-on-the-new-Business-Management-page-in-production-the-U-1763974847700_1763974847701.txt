Bug description
--------------
When I click on the new Business Management page in production,
the UI crashes with:

  ReferenceError: Can't find variable: React

Other pages work fine. Only the new Business Management UI is broken.

This means that some of the new React files are using JSX or the "React"
identifier without having React properly imported in that module.

Your task:
- Fix this error WITHOUT changing global build config if not needed.
- Make sure the Business Management page loads normally.

------------------------------------------------
STEP 1 – Locate the source file causing the error
------------------------------------------------
1. Search in the client code for the new admin business page:
   - Likely files:
     - client/src/pages/Admin/BusinessManagerPage.tsx
     - client/src/components/admin/BusinessUsersModal.tsx
     - or any other new JSX/TSX files you created for business management.

2. For each of these files, check the VERY TOP of the file:
   - If there is NO line like:
       import React from "react";
     or:
       import * as React from "react";
     then this is the problem.

------------------------------------------------
STEP 2 – Add explicit React imports to all new JSX/TSX files
------------------------------------------------
For every new file under the admin business management UI that uses JSX
(<Component />) or uses `React.FC`, make sure the file starts with:

   import React from "react";

If the file already imports hooks from react like:

   import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

replace it with:

   import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

or:

   import * as React from "react";
   const { useState, useEffect } = React;

The key point: the bundler/transpiler is generating `React.createElement`
calls and expects `React` to be defined in the module scope.
Without the import, `React` is undefined at runtime and we get the error.

Do NOT rely on a global React on window.

------------------------------------------------
STEP 3 – Check index/main entry files
------------------------------------------------
Verify that our main entry still imports React correctly:

- client/src/main.tsx or client/src/index.tsx should have:

   import React from "react";
   import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

Do not remove these imports.

------------------------------------------------
STEP 4 – Rebuild and test Business Management page
------------------------------------------------
1. Run the frontend build (or let Replit build).
2. Open the Business Management page (admin business list).
3. Confirm:
   - No more "Can't find variable: React".
   - The page renders the table normally.
   - All existing admin pages still work.

------------------------------------------------
Constraints
------------------------------------------------
- Do NOT change TypeScript / Babel / Vite JSX configuration unless absolutely necessary.
- Prefer the minimal fix: add explicit `import React from "react";` where missing.
- Do NOT touch server-side Python code for this issue.

Expected result
---------------
The Business Management page loads without crashing.
The error "ReferenceError: Can't find variable: React" no longer appears,
and the rest of the React app continues to work as before.
