Goal
----
Tighten the navigation and naming in the sidebar according to the current product direction.

Concrete changes:

1) Hide "אינטליגנציה לקוחות" completely:
   - Remove the "אינטליגנציה לקוחות" entry from the main sidebar (the one you see under CRM).
   - Remove or disable the corresponding route, so that typing its URL directly will not render the page.
   - If needed, redirect that route to a safe page (for example the main dashboard or "לידים").

2) Hide the "תזכורות" page from the sidebar:
   - The top-right bell icon (notifications modal) MUST remain as-is.
   - Only the full-page "תזכורות" entry in the sidebar should be removed.
   - Also remove/disable its route if it exists as a dedicated page. The notifications system should continue to work, only the standalone page should be unreachable.

3) Rename "CRM" → "משימות":
   - In the sidebar, change the label from "CRM" to "משימות".
   - Do NOT change the icon or the route path for now (it can still be /crm in the URL), only the visible text.
   - Inside the page:
     - Change any main heading that says "CRM" to "משימות".
     - Change any breadcrumb or title that uses the word "CRM" to say "משימות" instead.
   - Conceptually, this page is now the "Tasks" page of the system.
   - Do NOT change backend table names or API routes at this stage, only UI labels and routing names.

Technical implementation details
--------------------------------

1) Sidebar updates
   - Locate the React component that renders the main sidebar (the one that shows: לידים, WhatsApp, שיחות, CRM, אינטליגנציה לקוחות, ניהול עסקים, AI Prompts, ניהול משתמשים, הגדרות מערכת, לוח שנה, תזכורות).
     Typical file names may be:
       - client/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx
       - client/src/components/navigation/MainSidebar.tsx
   - In the array/list of nav items:
     - Find the item with label "אינטליגנציה לקוחות" and REMOVE it completely from the list.
     - Find the item with label "תזכורות" and REMOVE it completely from the list.
     - Find the item with label "CRM" and change the label to "משימות":
         from:
             label: "CRM",
         to:
             label: "משימות",

2) Routes protection (no access to removed pages)
   - Locate the router configuration (React Router) for these pages.
     Typical files:
       - client/src/router.tsx
       - client/src/routes/AppRoutes.tsx
   - Search for the routes that render:
       - CustomerIntelligence page (likely with path containing "customer-intelligence" or "client-intelligence").
       - Reminders page (likely with path containing "reminders").
   - For each of these routes:
       - Either remove the route entirely,
       - OR, if removal is risky, wrap them in a condition that will NEVER be true, such as:
           {false && <Route ... />}
       - Alternatively, redirect those paths to a safe default:
           <Route path="/customer-intelligence" element={<Navigate to="/leads" replace />} />
           <Route path="/reminders" element={<Navigate to="/tasks" replace />} />
     The goal: user cannot access these pages even by typing URL manually.

3) CRM page rebranding to Tasks
   - Locate the React component for the CRM page (the one currently rendered when clicking CRM in sidebar).
     Typical names:
       - client/src/pages/Crm/CrmPage.tsx
       - client/src/pages/CRM/Index.tsx
   - Inside that component:
       - Change the main title text "CRM" to "משימות".
       - If there is any subtitle, breadcrumb, or tab label that explicitly says "CRM", rename to "משימות".
   - If a layout or meta title is set (document.title), also update it to use "משימות".
   - Do NOT rename the file or change the route path yet; keep the internals working and only change visible text.

4) Permissions
   - Make sure there are NO leftover links or quick-actions pointing to:
       - customer intelligence page
       - the old reminders page
   - If any "View customer intelligence" or "Go to reminders" buttons exist, hide them or repoint them to relevant pages (for example to "לידים" or "משימות").

5) Testing checklist
   - After changes:
     - The sidebar should show:
       לידים, WhatsApp, שיחות, משימות, ניהול עסקים, AI Prompts, ניהול משתמשים, הגדרות מערכת, לוח שנה, התראות.
       (No "אינטליגנציה לקוחות", No "תזכורות".)
     - Clicking "משימות" opens the former CRM page, but all titles label it as "משימות".
     - The bell icon at the top still opens the notifications modal and works normally.
     - Typing the old URLs for:
         - customer intelligence page
         - reminders page
       does NOT show these pages anymore (either 404 or redirect to a safe page).
