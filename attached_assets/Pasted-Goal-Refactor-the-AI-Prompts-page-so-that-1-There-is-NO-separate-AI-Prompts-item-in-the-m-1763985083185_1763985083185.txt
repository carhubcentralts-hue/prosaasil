Goal
----
Refactor the "AI Prompts" page so that:
1) There is NO separate "AI Prompts" item in the main sidebar.
2) All AI prompts and AI-related settings live INSIDE the "הגדרות מערכת" (System Settings) page.
3) The "שאלות נפוצות" (FAQ) tab is removed from System Settings.
4) All of this is per-business (respecting current multi-tenant behavior).

We are only changing UI / routing and reusing existing logic as much as possible.

------------------------------------------------
STEP 1 – Remove "AI Prompts" from the sidebar
------------------------------------------------
1. Locate the main sidebar component (where we already removed "אינטליגנציה לקוחות" and "תזכורות").
   - The item currently labeled "AI Prompts" should be REMOVED from the nav items list.

2. After this change, the sidebar should show:
   - לידים, WhatsApp, שיחות, משימות, ניהול עסקים, ניהול משתמשים, הגדרות מערכת, לוח שנה, התראות (bell icon), etc.
   - No "AI Prompts" entry.

------------------------------------------------
STEP 2 – Prepare System Settings page for new AI tab(s)
------------------------------------------------
1. Locate the System Settings page component (the one rendered when clicking "הגדרות מערכת" in the sidebar).
   - It likely uses a Tabs component with something like:
     - כללי / הגדרות כלליות
     - תורים / הגדרות תורים
     - שאלות נפוצות (FAQ)
     - maybe more tabs.

2. Inside that component:
   - REMOVE the "שאלות נפוצות" (FAQ) tab completely:
     - Remove the tab header.
     - Remove or comment out the content panel for FAQ.
   - We do NOT need a FAQ section there anymore.

------------------------------------------------
STEP 3 – Embed the existing AI Prompts UI into System Settings
------------------------------------------------
We already have a full "AI Prompts" page/component.  
Instead of being a standalone page, we will reuse it as a tab inside System Settings.

1. Find the React component that currently renders the AI prompts page:
   - Something like:
       client/src/pages/AIPromptsPage.tsx
       or
       client/src/pages/admin/AIConfigPage.tsx
   - This component already handles:
       - Editing prompts for calls and/or WhatsApp.
       - Saving per-business configuration via existing APIs.

2. Refactor it into a reusable child component:
   - If it's currently a full page with its own layout, extract the core form(s) and logic into a component like:
       - `<BusinessAISettings />`
     located under:
       - client/src/components/settings/BusinessAISettings.tsx
     or similar.

   - This component should:
       - Receive the current business_id from context/auth (same as existing System Settings).
       - Load and save AI prompts exactly as before.
       - Display:
           - Prompt for calls (שיחות)
           - Prompt for WhatsApp
           - Any existing AI-related sliders/toggles (if you already have them).

3. In the System Settings page:
   - Add a NEW TAB called "הגדרות AI" or "AI / Prompts".
   - In the tab content panel, render the new `<BusinessAISettings />` component.

   Example (pseudocode):

   Tabs:
     - "כללי"
     - "תורים"
     - "AI / Prompts"

   Panels:
     - General settings panel
     - Scheduling settings panel
     - <BusinessAISettings />  // reusing the old AI Prompt forms

4. Make sure this tab works per-business:
   - It should use the same business_id as the other settings tabs.
   - If previously the AI Prompts page already worked per-business, reuse the same API calls and data model.

------------------------------------------------
STEP 4 – Route handling for old /ai-prompts URL
------------------------------------------------
We no longer want a standalone "AI Prompts" page, but there might still be an existing route.

1. In the router:
   - Either remove the `/ai-prompts` route entirely,
   - Or, if you prefer not to delete it, change it to redirect into System Settings with the AI tab selected, for example:

     <Route
       path="/ai-prompts"
       element={<Navigate to="/settings?tab=ai" replace />}
     />

2. If the System Settings page uses `?tab=` or a similar mechanism, update it to support selecting the new AI tab via query or state.

------------------------------------------------
STEP 5 – Per-business behavior (multi-tenant)
------------------------------------------------
1. Ensure the AI settings inside System Settings use the same business scoping as the rest of that page:
   - Use the current logged-in user's business_id from context/auth.
   - Do NOT show or allow editing prompts for other businesses unless the user is a system_admin and the UI explicitly switches businesses.

2. System_admin can still switch between businesses via the Business Management flow.
   - Once they are "inside" a specific business context, the System Settings → AI tab should show that business’s AI prompts.

------------------------------------------------
STEP 6 – Testing checklist
------------------------------------------------
After implementing these changes, verify:

1. Sidebar:
   - "AI Prompts" no longer appears as a standalone menu item.
   - "אינטליגנציה לקוחות" and "תזכורות" are also not visible (as already done).

2. System Settings page:
   - No "שאלות נפוצות" (FAQ) tab.
   - A new tab for AI exists (e.g., "AI / Prompts").
   - This tab shows the same AI prompt fields that used to be in the standalone AI Prompts page.

3. Behavior per business:
   - When logged in as a regular business owner, System Settings → AI tab shows only that business’s prompts.
   - When logged in as system_admin and switching to another business context, the AI tab shows that business’s prompts.

4. Old URL:
   - Navigating to the old AI Prompts route (`/ai-prompts` or similar) either:
       - redirects to System Settings with the AI tab,
       - or returns 404 / is unused (as long as no one depends on it).

Make sure no backend logic is changed apart from what is required to support moving the UI. Reuse existing APIs for saving/loading the prompts.
