Task: Final validation for Outbound Calls (BUILD 174) – no regressions

You already implemented outbound AI calls (BUILD 174).
Now I want you to verify that everything is clean, consistent and backward-compatible.

Please do ALL of the following:
	1.	Code & structure sanity
	•	List all files you modified for BUILD 174 (backend + frontend).
	•	Make sure there are no duplicate routes, services or models for outbound calls.
	•	Confirm that routes_outbound.py (or equivalent) is imported and registered exactly once in the Flask app.
	2.	DB & migrations
	•	Verify that the changes to CallLog and OutboundCallTemplate are fully migrated:
	•	Check the migration files.
	•	Make sure the production docker-compose / startup path runs those migrations.
	•	Confirm there is no breaking change for existing rows (null-safe defaults, safe enums, etc.).
	3.	Concurrency limits
	•	Add or confirm unit/helper tests (or at least small internal checks) for call_limiter:
	•	Max 3 outbound calls per business.
	•	Max 5 total calls (inbound + outbound) per business.
	•	When limits are exceeded:
	•	Outbound API returns the correct error and message.
	•	Inbound /webhook/incoming_call returns polite TwiML and DOES NOT start an AI session.
	•	Make sure there are no race conditions (reuse a single counting logic).
	4.	Inbound calls regression check
	•	Confirm that the inbound call flow still works exactly as before when under limits:
	•	Business detection.
	•	CallConfig + CallState state machine.
	•	Media WebSocket and AI behavior.
	•	Make sure no outbound-specific changes broke the existing inbound webhooks.
	5.	Outbound calls behavior
	•	Verify that:
	•	Outbound calls are saved with direction='outbound'.
	•	lead_id and template are stored correctly.
	•	The AI greeting uses the lead’s name and outbound prompt.
	•	Confirm that /webhook/outbound_call integrates correctly with the same realtime pipeline (no duplicate logic, just a small branching by direction).
	6.	Frontend checks
	•	Ensure the new “שיחות יוצאות” page:
	•	Is wired correctly in the sidebar and routing.
	•	Respects selection limits (1–3 leads max).
	•	Shows clear Hebrew error messages when limits (3 outbound / 5 total) are hit.
	•	Verify no existing pages (Leads, Calls, WhatsApp, CRM) were broken by the new routes/components.
	7.	Diagnostics & docs
	•	Run LSP/type checks and fix any remaining diagnostics.
	•	Run existing tests and add small sanity tests where easy (especially around the limiter).
	•	Update replit.md with a short “Outbound Calls – Validation Checklist” summarizing:
	•	Models used
	•	Routes added
	•	Limits (3 outbound / 5 total)
	•	What was manually tested

Only after you finish, give me a short, structured summary:
	•	Which files were touched
	•	What you verified
	•	Any remaining TODOs or edge cases I should know about.
