# Hebrew AI Call Center CRM

## Overview
This project is a Hebrew AI Call Center CRM designed for "שי דירות ומשרדים בע״מ". It integrates OpenAI GPT-4o for intelligent Hebrew conversations, real-time Hebrew transcription via Whisper, and professional real estate-specific responses. The system handles live Twilio calls, providing a comprehensive solution for managing customer interactions, with the ambition to enhance real estate operations through advanced AI and CRM capabilities.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Code organization: Clean, unified files without duplicates. Always merge improvements into existing files rather than creating new "_improved" versions.
Visual focus: Currently working visually only - login page only, no dashboards. Backend functionality (calls, CRM, WhatsApp) preserved intact.
