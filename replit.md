# Recent Changes

## BUILD 90 (October 15, 2025) - CRITICAL FIXES: call_status + business_id + Deployment
- **🔧 CRITICAL FIX 1**: Fixed "null value in column call_status violates not-null constraint" error
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Production DB has NOT NULL `call_status` field but models_sql.py missing it → fallback call_log creation fails
  - **SYMPTOM**: `stream_status` and `handle_recording` creating fallback → DB rejects with NOT NULL violation → no call_log saved
  - **FIX 1**: Added `call_status` field to CallLog model with default="in-progress"
  - **FIX 2**: Updated all fallback call_log creations to include `call_status`
  - **FIX 3**: `incoming_call` → `call_status="initiated"`
  - **FIX 4**: `stream_status` → `call_status="in-progress"`
  - **FIX 5**: `handle_recording` → `call_status="completed"`
  - **Files**: server/models_sql.py, server/routes_twilio.py
- **🔧 CRITICAL FIX 2**: Fixed "business_id foreign key violation" error
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Hardcoded business_id=1 but production DB empty → no business exists!
  - **SYMPTOM**: ForeignKeyViolation: Key (business_id)=(1) is not present in table "business"
  - **FIX 1**: Dynamic business detection - find active business or any business
  - **FIX 2**: Auto-healing fallback - create default business if none exists
  - **FIX 3**: Applied to all 4 call_log creation points: incoming_call, _create_lead_from_call, stream_status, handle_recording
  - **Files**: server/routes_twilio.py
- **🔧 CRITICAL FIX 3**: Fixed Autoscale deployment failures
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Missing INTERNAL_SECRET in deployment + multiple port exposure confusion
  - **FIX 1**: Auto-generate INTERNAL_SECRET if not in environment (secure fallback)
  - **FIX 2**: Clarified port architecture - only Flask on 0.0.0.0:PORT (external), Baileys on 127.0.0.1:3300 (internal only)
  - **FIX 3**: Updated start_production.sh with clear external/internal port documentation
  - **Files**: start_production.sh
- **Impact**: Production deployment works + auto-creates business if needed + all calls save successfully

## BUILD 89 (October 15, 2025) - CRITICAL FIX: Complete Call Processing Chain
- **🔧 CRITICAL FIX**: Fixed entire call processing chain from ImportError to call_log creation
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Chain of failures starting with ImportError → no call_log → "No call_log found for final summary"
  - **FIX 1 - Import Error**: Changed `CustomerIntelligenceService` → `CustomerIntelligence`, moved imports to top
  - **FIX 2 - Immediate call_log**: `incoming_call` now creates call_log IMMEDIATELY (before thread) so webhooks find it
  - **FIX 3 - Thread Safety**: `_create_lead_from_call` now has proper try/except, no duplicate imports
  - **FIX 4 - Self-Heal**: `stream_status` creates fallback call_log if missing (self-healing)
  - **FIX 5 - Self-Heal**: `handle_recording` creates fallback call_log if missing (self-healing)
  - **Files**: server/routes_twilio.py (comprehensive rewrite of call flow)
  - **Architecture**: call_log created FIRST → thread enriches with customer/lead → webhooks always find it
- **Impact**: Zero "call_log not found" errors - every call is captured regardless of thread/webhook timing

## BUILD 88 (October 15, 2025) - CRITICAL FIX: Missing to_number in Lead Creation
- **🔧 CRITICAL FIX**: Fixed "null value in column to_number" error in lead creation thread
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: `_create_lead_from_call` created call_log without to_number → NOT NULL constraint violation
  - **FIX 1**: Added `to_number` parameter to `_create_lead_from_call` function
  - **FIX 2**: Added `to_number` field to CallLog model in models_sql.py
  - **FIX 3**: Extract `to_number` from Twilio webhook in `incoming_call`
  - **FIX 4**: Pass `to_number` to lead creation thread with default fallback
  - **Files**: server/routes_twilio.py, server/models_sql.py
- **Impact**: Lead creation now works without errors - all calls save with complete data

## BUILD 87 (October 14, 2025) - CRITICAL FIX: Duplicate call_sid Race Condition
- **🔧 CRITICAL FIX**: Fixed race condition causing duplicate call_log records and "Failing row contains" errors
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Multiple threads created call_log simultaneously → duplicate call_sid → database errors → "Call SID not found"
  - **FIX 1 - Database Level**: Added unique constraint on call_log.call_sid (prevents duplicates at DB level)
  - **FIX 2 - Code Level**: Added duplicate error handling with rollback in _create_call_log_on_start
  - **Migration 15**: Removes existing duplicates then creates unique index on call_sid
  - **Files**: server/db_migrate.py, server/media_ws_ai.py
- **Impact**: Eliminates production errors - calls now save correctly without duplicates
